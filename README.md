The `shadowbans` repo documents work investigating how shadow banning contributes to invisible information in online communities. Running in collaboration with [Jef Ausloos](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/a/u/j.ausloos/j.ausloos.html) (PI) and [Paddy Leerssen](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/l/e/p.j.leerssen/p.j.leerssen.html).

Shadow banning occurs when a user's content is hidden or de-emphasized without their knowledge, often through algorithms or moderation practices. This means users might think their posts are visible, but others can't see them, leading to a form of censorship that isn't immediately apparent. We intend to explore the impact of these practices on information visibility and to shed light on how they shape our digital interactions.
